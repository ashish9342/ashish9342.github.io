## Q2. Please respond to the following question.

### What are the specific kind of work you wish to pursue in LINE?

1. After creating chatbot application, now I want to create or work on the chat application and undestand how the data is tranffered and is secured from others. 

### Among the apps you are currently using, which ones are you particularly interested in or using frequently? (web/smartphone apps are both acceptible; make sure to provide one frequently used app and what you have learned about in the last one year.)


1. I have stared reading post in Medium. Thing what I have learnt is giving back to the community. Recently written a blog on JS execution phase. Started writing other blogs related to it, so developer can know how JS engine work.

### Among the technologies you are recently interersted in, give us the name of one and the reason it draws your attention (list upto three points).

Recently started react. Points that have drawn my attention towards it are
1. Wanted something new and to try in my projects.
2. It's trending and most of developers are using it.
3. Easy and Good community Support.
4. Out of 10 jobs in stackoverflow, react jobs are 7-8 (Font-end developer), more opportunity.  

### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?

1. Sales Chatbot with Google Dialogflow
**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS, Angular, Datatables, Amcharts, XSJS, MySQL, Dialogflow.

Implemented chatbot solution for a world’s leading electronics giant. This bot basically replaces the traditional way to looking into sales and related daily information, giving flexibility to the executives to aggregate, manipulate and translate sales data in from of reports and histograms.

**Task** : To develop the creative UI, where user can see the reports on the go.

**Knowledge/Skills**
1. Client server was too secured that it was not allowing the connection(dialogflow URL blocked/blacklisted) as the dialogflow webhook was not able to communicate with the backend code. Changed the architecture as we were working on POC, now in the new case Dataflow was from UI=>Dialogflow=>UI=>BE=>UI. Though the solution was not perfect, came up with solution to show the data in UI.
2. Developed modules so that same can be used for developing new reports by just passing the parameters (No code redundancy).
3. First time worked on speech to text functionality, got most of the things from google, stackoverflow.
